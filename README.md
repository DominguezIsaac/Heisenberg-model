This work explores the implementation of a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to approximate the ground state energy of the one-dimensional Heisenberg spin chain, with a focus on exploiting symmetries to enhance computational efficiency.

Aiming on the SU(2)-invariant Heisenberg XXX model the study uses symmetry-based ansatz design to constrain the variational search space to physically relevant subspaces. The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is employed for circuit parametrization while by applying ansatz symmetrization through the twirling technique equivariant ansatz are constructed.

The numerical results aim to demonstrate the superior performance of the equivariant ansatz over generic alternatives, especially in scenarios where the symmetry sector of the ground state is known. This approach underscores the value of symmetry-aware methods in quantum simulations.
